# How and when to organize files

`ORG.md` Files within folders means there are specific rules for organizing files within that folder you must adhere to.

## Organization Rules

- All rules are subject to your best judgement.
- Any organization you make is subject to be changed later if decided by committee.

## Root Folder Organization

- Assets is for:
  - Artist resources, (e.g. sprites, sounds, project files, etc)
  - Godot Resource files (e.g. TileSet, Animation, Material)
  - Auxiliary data files (e.g. Dialogue Trees, Scene-specific data files, etc).
  - Temporary Assets should be here, with a preliminary organization.
- Game is for:
  - Scenes & Prefabs
  - Game Code
  - Anything that does not fit Assets
