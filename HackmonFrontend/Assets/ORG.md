# Organization Rules

- All rules are subject to your best judgement.
- Any organization you make is subject to be changed later if decided by committee.

## Assets Folder Organization

- BattleSprites is for creature visuals used during combat. Once animations are implemented, each species will likely have it's own dedicated folder.
- OpponentSprites is for human visuals used during combat.
- Podiums is used for the sprites on which battlers stand during combat.
- OverworldSprites is for visual assets used in the overworld maps.
 - Characters is used for creature and human visuals used in the overworld maps.
 - Tiles is used for tile maps for constructing the overworld.
- UI is for any visual assets pertaining to the user interface such as buttons and status bars. These elements are typically divided into layers which should be foldered together for sake of being tidy.
 - Icons is for simple unlayered visuals used to represent concepts that are often categorizable and grouped together.
