Overview
--------
Echo-Ranger uses a modular code design, the likes of which I am probably not qualified to explain, so I'll just leave
this here for Sprocket to fill out later.

# Structure:

Please only use an IDE that supports code style via DotSettings, so you get proper code style suggestions.

## Project naming conventions:

Private properties/fields _lowerCamelCase

Public properties/fields UpperCamelCase

There are many more code style suggestions that are in the DotSettings.
