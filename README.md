Echo Ranger
======

This is the code repository for our game, Echo Ranger.

Overview
--------
Echo-Ranger uses a modular code design, the likes of which I am probably not qualified to explain, so I'll just leave this here for Sprocket to fill out later.

### Structure:
Something something styleguide, something something setup instructions.

### Requirements & Setup:

List any and all required plugins and tools here for building the game.
