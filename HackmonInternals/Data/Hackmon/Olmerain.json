  "Description": "Olmin that are sufficiently well-fed eventually become known as olmerain, abandoning their vegetarian diets in favor of live prey. They utilize their control of water to drown their prey from a safe distance, before closing in for the kill. Strangely, they have developed fully functional eyes but never open them willingly.",
